# Pseudocode for removing leading spaces
# 1. Define a function that takes a string as input.
# 2. Initialize an index variable to 0.
# 3. Loop through the string:
#    - If the current character is a space, increment the index.
#    - If a non-space character is found, break the loop.
# 4. Return the substring starting from the first non-space character.
